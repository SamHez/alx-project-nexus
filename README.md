# ALX Project Nexus – ProDev Frontend Engineering

## Overview

This repository is a personal documentation hub created during the **ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering Program**. It captures the key concepts, tools, and lessons learned while building real-world frontend applications and collaborating with other engineers.

Project Nexus exists as both a learning record and a reference point for future projects, showcasing how modern frontend ideas come together in practice.

## What I Learned

Throughout the program, I gained hands-on experience with modern frontend technologies and workflows, including:

- **React & Next.js** for building component-driven and scalable user interfaces
- **TypeScript** for writing safer and more maintainable code
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, utility-first UI design
- **API Integration** using real third party services
- **System Design & Analysis** for structuring frontend applications properly
- Exposure to **GraphQL** concepts and data-driven UI thinking

Beyond tools, the program reinforced the importance of clean code, reusability, and user focused design.

## Capstone Project: Film Flux

One of the main practical applications of these learnings is **Film Flux**, a movie discovery and recommendation web application.

Film Flux allows users to:
- Browse trending and popular movies
- Search for movies by title
- View detailed movie information
- Save and manage a personal watchlist

The application fetches real-time data from the **TMDB API** and focuses on responsive design, reusable components, and smooth user experience. User preferences are stored locally, keeping the app simple while still feeling personal.

## Challenges & Takeaways

Working on real-world scenarios highlighted common frontend challenges such as managing shared state, handling API errors, and designing responsive layouts. Solving these problems strengthened my understanding of React patterns, data flow, and UI consistency.

One major takeaway from the program is the value of collaboration. Working alongside other frontend learners and integrating with backend APIs mirrored how modern product teams operate in real environments.
